"""V12.70 — THE THREE REPOS MUST CARRY THE SAME LOGIC.

The two school deployments (gosaportal, schoolconnectdemo) are generated from
this repo. Their pages legitimately differ in BRANDING (school name, motto,
address, phone, email, logo extension) and must be identical in EVERYTHING else.
A fix that reaches only the generator is a fix the schools never receive — that
has happened repeatedly, and it is invisible because the pages still render.

This audit normalises the brand strings away and then compares the files that
carry behaviour. Exit 1 on any unexplained difference.
