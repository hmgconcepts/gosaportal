## 🛠️ Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Database and Authentication Setup (Supabase)
We use Supabase for free, secure, and scalable backend infrastructure.
1. **Create a Free Project**: Head to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and create a free tier project.
2. **Execute Schema**: In your project's **SQL Editor**, paste and run these files **in this order** (each shows a success message):
   1. `database/schema.sql` — core platform (students, staff, fees, RLS…)
   2. `database/voting-schema.sql` — voting & polls
   3. `database/cbt-schema.sql` — the CBT / online-exam engine
   4. `database/reportcard-schema.sql` — flexible report cards (auto-links CBT results)
   5. `database/enterprise-schema.sql` — timetable generator, QR check-in, diary, surveys, menu, 2FA, i18n
3. **Get Credentials**: Go to Project Settings → API and copy your **Project URL** and **anon public key**.
4. **Link Frontend**: Open `assets/js/config.js` and replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_URL` and `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with your copied values.

### Step 2: Hosting and Build Process
This platform supports the build type you selected during generation: **TRADITIONAL**.

**Traditional Build Workflow (Static Hosting):**
1. **Deployment Platform**: You can host this instantly on platforms like GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages.
2. **Upload Files**: Simply drag and drop or push the entire directory contents to your chosen platform.
3. **No Build Step Required**: Since this is purely static (HTML/CSS/JS), it serves immediately without any build configuration.

### Step 3: Admin Initialization
1. Visit the deployed site in your browser.
2. Click **Sign in to Portal** and choose **Request access** to register an account.
3. Head back to the Supabase SQL Editor and elevate your newly created user to an admin by running:
   ```sql
   UPDATE profiles SET role='admin', status='approved' WHERE email='your-email@example.com';
   ```
4. You can now log in, access the dashboard, and begin approving staff and students directly from the **Directory** or **Staff** modules.

## 🌐 HMG Academy Ecosystem
This platform is a proud part of the **HMG Academy Ecosystem**. It's optimized for lead generation, pointing prospective clients and students to [HMG Concepts](https://hmgconcepts.pages.dev/). The software stays free forever, with robust architecture preventing any dependency on paid AI APIs or costly third-party services.


## School Connect v1 Final Deployment Note
Run `database/complete-schema.sql` once in Supabase SQL Editor for a fresh deployment. It is now cumulative and self-contained: it includes base schema, CBT, voting, report cards, enterprise tables, class fee structures, product store, status audit log, parent-child access policies, staff check-in deadline settings, and schema-cache reload notifications. The smaller update SQL files are retained only for upgrading older deployed clients.

## School Connect V5.1 definitive CBT repair

The maintained V5.1 repair documentation is in `docs/v5/`. Before deployment read `BUG-FIX-REPORT.md` and `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE-V5.md`. For an existing database, the CBT zero-score fix requires `database/cbt-v5.1-zero-score-hotfix.sql` (the full new schema already includes it); frontend-only deployment is insufficient. No paid AI API is used.
